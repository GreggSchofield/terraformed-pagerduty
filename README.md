[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) is a SaaS for agile incident management that enables Software, DevOps and
Site-Reliability Engineers to respond in near real-time to issues with critical software systems. Whilst it is possible
for PagerDuty to be configured end-to-end using the console alone, for anything other than trivial configurations,
[infrastructure as code/configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (IaC) techniques should be
utilised to gain speed, consistency and accountability to name but a few.
